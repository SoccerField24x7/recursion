## Recursion
Last week I went on 2 interviews.  Both asked me questions related to recursion:

1) Write a recursive anonymous PHP function to reverse a string using strlen and substr functions.

2) Have you heard of the fizz buzz test?  I had not (apparently I should have!), but they added a twist: Create a **recursive** function that does not modify the original array (immutable), and for each element outputs fizz if it's divisible by 2, buzz if it's divisible by 5 and fizzbuzz if it is divisible by 2 and 5.

The initial commit will be the solution I provided during the interview.  I have since updated my answers to improve them.
